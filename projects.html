		<h2>Card Detection with PiCamera</h2>
		<em>Aug 2021 - Oct 2021</em>
		<p>
			This project involves the usage of Raspberry pi4 as a component in a system to perform object detection tasks. The aim of the tasks 
			is to detect cards that would be scattered about tagged onto black boxes. Once the label is detected, the 
			raspberry pi conveys the information to other parts of the system which are in charge of other tasks. The overall system 
			is an autonomous robot which will traverse a given arena to each obstacles which will be tagged with a card. An 
			android device will be used to setup a virtual environment where the best route would be plot and the robot will execute the 
			movement information sent to it. My responsibility lies in training a Object Detection model which will run on the raspberry pi 4 
			to gather IDs from labels detected.
		</p>
		<p>
			The dataset given consist of 31 images and image augmentation has to be performed to increase the size of the dataset as well as cater 
			to different environmental conditions such as lighting. After image augmentation is performed, the dataset is fed to an efficient-net model 
			for transfer learning using Tensorflow lite model maker. The tflite model will then be used in conjunction with OpenCV to display a bounding box 
			and text. Examples:

		<h2>OCR Notes</h2>
		<em>Jul 2020 - Dec 2020</em>
		<p>
			The main objective behind OCR Notes is to make note taking faster and easier. Notes recorded simple by
			snapping a photo and allowing the application to process it. Optionally, images containing paragraphs
			of notes may be uploaded to be recorded. This project also serves as a familiarisation project for me
			to learn more about React and how to integrate external libraries into it. Further improvements and
			features will be included in the future.

			An off-the-shelf library is used to perform the OCR tasks - Tesseract.js

		<h2>Map.sg</h2>
		<em>Aug 2020 - Nov 2020</em>
		<p>
			Developed as part of an academic group project to experience basic software development lifecycles.
			Built with React + Redux, using Firestore and Firebase Authentication as well as external APIs from
			Mapbox, Datamall, GovTech.

		<h2>SPade</h2>
		<em>Apr 2016 â€“ Aug 2016</em>
		<p>
			SPade is a short form for SP Web Auto Grading System. It was developed as a Final Year Project for
			me and four other team members. The system automatically grades practical assignments set by lecturers
			for students. Students submit source code for the system to grade. The system grades output produced
			by the submitted code and compares it with an output produced by test cases. A grade is returned based 
			on the number of test cases passed. The system aims to automate practical sessions conducted by
			lecturers in school and makes learning programming more smooth.
