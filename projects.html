		<h2>OCR Notes</h2>
		<em>Jul 2020 - Dec 2021</em>
		<p>
			The main objective behind OCR Notes is to make note taking faster and easier. Notes recorded simple by
			snapping a photo and allowing the application to process it. Optionally, images containing paragraphs
			of notes may be uploaded to be recorded. This project also serves as a familiarisation project for me
			to learn more about React and how to integrate external libraries into it. Further improvements and
			features will be included in the future.

			An off-the-shelf library is used to perform the OCR tasks - Tesseract.js

		<h2>React.js simple time interval workout app</h2>
		<em>Apr 2020 - Jun 2021</em>
		<p>
			A simple React app meant to be a familiarisation project to learn how to use React. The main idea is to
			simply provide users with a clean interface to create a time interval workout and save them within their
			account.

		<h2>SPade</h2>
		<em>Apr 2016 â€“ Aug 2016</em>
		<p>
			SPade is a short form for SP Web Auto Grading System. It was developed as a Final Year Project for
			me and four other team members. The system automatically grades practical assignments set by lecturers
			for students. Students submit source code for the system to grade. The system grades output produced
			by the submitted code and compares it with an output produced by test cases. A grade is returned based 
			on the number of test cases passed. The system aims to automate practical sessions conducted by
			lecturers in school and makes learning programming more smooth.
