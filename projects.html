		<h2>SPade</h2>
		<em>Apr 2016 â€“ Aug 2016</em>
		<p>
			SPade is a short form for SP Web Auto Grading System. It was developed as a Final Year Project for
			me and four other team members. The system automatically grades practical assignments set by lecturers
			for students. Students submit source code for the system to grade. The system grades output produced
			by the submitted code and compares it with an output produced by test cases. A grade is returned based 
			on the number of test cases passed. The system aims to automate practical sessions conducted by
			lecturers in school and makes learning programming more smooth.
