			<h1>RPI Card Detection</h1>
			<p>
				The overall tasks of the project is to have an autonomous robot navigate a known terrain to search for cards which are 
				stuck onto obstacles. The location of obstacles are set via an Android devices and a path finding algorithm is used to find the 
				shortest route to the next obstacles. Once the robot reach the location, the RPI mounted on it will perform identification of the card 
				using the PiCamera and communicate the label back to the Android device.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				I was in charge of the object detection tasks. The aim is to detect cards stuck on the obstacles. Once the label is detected, the 
				raspberry pi conveys the label via Bluetooth to the Android device so that it can update and reflect the label that was detected.
				The Android device has a a virtual environment where the best route and labels detected would be reflected. My responsibility lies 
				in training of a Object Detection model which will run on the RaspberryPi 4. The main issue was finding out ways to run the object
				detection model on an edge device such as RaspberryPi4 and the solution determined was to use tensorflow-lite.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				The dataset given consist of 31 images and image augmentation has to be performed to increase the size of the dataset as well as cater 
				to different environmental conditions such as lighting. After image augmentation is performed, the dataset is used for training.
				The model will perform detection and OpenCv is used to display a bounding box and text.

				<img src='/img/mdp3.jpg'/>
